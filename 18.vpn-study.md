I think you're missing the package **network-manager-sstp-gnome**. Here's what I did to make it work: There's a PPA that provides precompiled packages for the necessary software. I added that with:

```text
$ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:eivnaes/network-manager-sstp
...
$ sudo apt-get update
```

Then I installed the 3 packages like so:

```text
$ sudo apt-get install sstp-client network-manager-sstp network-manager-sstp-gnome
```

I then rebooted but it should do to restart the network-manager service:

```text
$ sudo service network-manager restart
```

After that you should be able to choose the SSTP option in the dialog where you can add a new connection. You can open that dialog with the command

```text
$ nm-connection-editor
```

And then click the button that reads "Add".
